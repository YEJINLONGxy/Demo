可以通过几种不同的方式表示字符串:
如单引号（'...'）或双引号（"..."）。下面的例子能帮助你更好的理解字符串。

>>> s = 'I am chinese'
>>> s
'I am chinese'
>>> s = 'Here is a line \
... split in two lines'
>>> s
'Here is a line split in two lines'
>>> s = "Here is line \n split in two lines"
>>> s
'Here is line \n split in two lines'
>>> s = "Here is a line \n split in two line"
>>> s
'Here is a line \n split in two line'
>>> print(s)
Here is a line 
 split in two line

如果你想要分几行输入字符串，并且希望行尾的换行符自动包含到字符串当中;
可以使用三对引号："""...""" 或 '''...''' 。

>>> print("""\
... Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
...     -h                              Display this usage message
...     -H hostname                     Hostname to comnect to
... """)
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
	-h 				Display this usage message
	-H hostname 			Hostname to comnect to

>>>
